# Summer-Olympics-Medals-Competition

This is the final project of the course "Visualization Technologies"(d3.js) in fall semester at Northeastern University, visualizing how the countries performed in Summer Olympics in past 40 years by medal count.
The purpose of this project is to explore how the countries performed in all disciplines chronologically. After selecting a country, users can go through a 40-year history of Summer Olympics of this country. They will find at which disciplines the country is good at and explore more stories following the change of medals.
